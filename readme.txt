A basic WordPress plugin for breadcrumbs with advanced capabilities for extending.

== Description ==

Provides the theme and plugin developers an easy way to build and implement highly customizable breadcrumb functionality, specifically tailored to their needs.
Supports a lot of filters and hooks, and is written in OOP style, giving developers full control over the breadcrumb trail items and appearance.
This plugin can also be embedded in themes, instead of installing it as a WordPress plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Install Carbon Breadcrumbs either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. That's it. You're ready to go! Please, refer to the Configuration section for examples and usage information.

== Configuration ==

If you install Carbon Breadcrumbs as a WordPress Plugin, or if you define the `CARBON_BREADCRUMB_ENABLE_ADMIN` constant to `true`, a "Carbon Breadcrumbs" page will appear in the Settings menu in the WordPress admin. There you can modify the breadcrumb trail rendering options.
